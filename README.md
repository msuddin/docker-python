# Purpose

Question: What is the purpose of this project?

Answer: To get a simple understanding of Python and how to write tests in it
* Python does not have an entry point like Java, C++, C# etc. Each line of each file is executed sequentially
* An __init__.py file is needed in each directory to allow the python interpreter to mark the directory as a module

# Instructions on running
From the root directory of the project, run the following command:
```
python sample_python.py
